# DataMiningNotebooks

Please see the following data mining example notebooks that go along with my Data Mining companion class at Southern Methodist University.  

Notebooks are numbered by the unit (i.e., week) at which they are covered in the class. Other class examples are prefixed with "E" and then the number of the example (they are not ties with a specific week). Also included here are the initial notebooks for various in-class assignments we use throughout the semester. 

To use the notebooks you can either download the repository as a zip file (top right corner) or you can use a git checkout via the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/eclarson/DataMiningNotebooks.git
```

This will install the entire git repository into a new directory and you can always update the directory via git. 

Please direct any questions to the course instructor or to Professor Larson (eclarson@smu.edu)
